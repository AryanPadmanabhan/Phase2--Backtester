# Phase2--Backtester

A strategy must be tested among different stocks to see if it has an actual 'edge' compared to flipping a coin. That's why this backtester was useful when testing different stratgies. 

With the ability to input the stocks to test, the success and loss threshold, and the conditions, I was able to find out which stratgies worked and which ones didn't. 

I didn't just use mathematically calculations to predict the stocks's next move, but also tested a combination of price action, volume, and other metrics. 

The backtester code shown is the bare backbone of what each test consisted of. However, each test had a similar, but different layout.
